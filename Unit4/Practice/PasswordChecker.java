// Exercise: Password Checker
//
// Write a program with a method called passwordCheck() to return if the String is a valid password.
// The method should have the signature shown in the starter code.
//
// The password must be at least 8 characters long and may only consist of letters and digits. To
// pass the autograder, you will need to print the boolean return value from the passwordCheck()
// method.
//
// Hint: Consider creating a String that contains all the letters in the alphabet and a String that
// contains all digits. If the password has a character that isn’t in one of those Strings, then
// it’s an illegitimate password!

// How to approach this:
// Break the problem into smaller problems. What are simpler versions of this problem?

// Related example script: LoopsAndStrings.java

// Have fun!



public class PasswordChecker
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Prompt the user to enter their password and pass their string
        // to the passwordCheck method to determine if it is valid.
    }

//    public static boolean passwordCheck(String password)
//    {
        // Create this method so that it checks to see that the password
        // is at least 8 characters long and only contains letters
        // and numbers.
//    }
}
