// Preconditions:
// A precondition is a condition that must be true just prior to the execution of a section of
// program code in order for the method to behave as expected. There is no expectation that the
// method will check to ensure preconditions are satisfied.

// Postcondition:
// A postcondition is a condition that must always be true after the execution of a section of
// program code. Postconditions describe the outcome of the execution in terms of what is being
// returned or the state of an object.
